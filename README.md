# The Speech Games

## Summary

Many of the children I work with have specific goals they target that are mostly speech related. The Speech Games was created in order to provide those
kids with more interactive games that they'll enjoy while also giving people the flexibility to choose what words they want to work on.

There is currently only one game in the speech games, Cariboo. A fantastic game that involves having children say words and then "opening" a panel to see if a ball
hides behind it.

The only other thing that can be selected are simple flash cards.

I am hoping to add more games as time goes on!
